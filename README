Abstract 

With the increasing number of family cars, urban traffic congestion has become more and more common, which has 
a great impact on people's lives. In order to alleviate the traffic 
pressure caused by traffic congestion, the roundabout came into 
being. Compared with ordinary intersections, roundabouts are 
superior in traffic efficiency and traffic control. However, 
research has found that the number of halts per vehicle at 
roundabouts has increased relative to ordinary intersections, 
which means that there is an increased possibility of large-scale 
congestion and driving conflicts in today's huge traffic flow. This 
makes it possible to add traffic lights to the roundabout to control 
traffic flow to alleviate traffic congestion and driving conflicts. 
This paper aims to improve the traffic model of the ordinary two lane roundabout and analyze whether different traffic light 
control methods are conducive to improving the traffic efficiency 
of the roundabout in the scenario of heavy traffic flow. Four 
improved models are established and compared with basic two lane roundabout and signalized intersection. Based on two 
scenarios with different traffic volume, we analyze these modelsâ€™
performance through multiple evaluation metrics. Results 
illustrates that roundabout with central cross has the best 
performance in the two scenarios, and proves that these two traffic 
light control methods failed to improve the traffic efficiency of 
roundabout in heavy traffic scenarios.
